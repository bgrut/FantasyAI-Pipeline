As an artificial intelligence (AI) model developed for providing assistance on computer science questions, I don't have real-time access or interaction with databases like YouTube Shorts and TikTok to collect specific user data about their current trending topics related AI in a ranking manner based solely upon the content. This requires manual analysis that cannot be done using machine learning algorithms as it involves understanding of human behavior (user engagement). 

However, I can provide you with general insights on how trends like these might interact:
1) **YouTube Shorts** - As an AI model developed by Deepseek for providing assistance in computer science-related questions and tasks. It's common to see short videos embedded into YouTube pages or other similar platforms showing content based off of user behaviors (views, comments etc). This could potentially be linked with the trending topics on TikTok as it might share views/likes count across both platform but have different algorithms for video processing and insights.
2) **TikTok** - Similar to YouTube Shorts, users may see short videos embedded in social media platforms like Facebook's Metro by @metroidpocket or a similar TikTok-like app that showcases content based on user engagement data (likes/shares). This can also be linked with the AI trends of other platform as they share views and likes count.
3) **AI in Social Media** - Many social platforms use machine learning models to understand users' preferences, track online activities etc., leading them towards trending topics that might mirror current TikTok or YouTube Shorts patterns (shares/views). For example, if AI is more prevalent on public spaces like Facebook groups and influencers using the app during peak social events in a country such as China.
4) **AI trends from Twitter** - As an artificial intelligence model developed by Deepseek for providing assistance related to computer science topics of tweets posted via @twitter, users can be linked with trending AI-related content based on their interaction data (tweeting/retweet counts etc). 
5) **Influencer Behavior Trends** - As an artificial intelligence model developed by Deepseek for providing assistance in computer science topics of influencers' posts and shares, users can be linked with trending AI-related content based on their interaction data (likes/shares count etc). 
6) **YouTube Channels related to tech trends** - YouTube has a vast collection of channels that often focus or host the latest news in different topics like technology. These platforms could potentially capture some similar patterns as TikTok Shorts, and users interact with these content based on their view counts/likes count etc., which can be linked to AI-related trending topic according to machine learning models trained for video processing purposes.
7) **AI trends in the gaming industry** - As an artificial intelligence model developed by Deepseek focused towards providing assistance related topics of games, users may see different content based on their gameplay data (achievements/victories etc).  This could potentially be linked to trending AI-related topic.
8) **AI trends in the education sector** - Similar patterns can happen as an artificial intelligence model developed by Deepseek for providing assistance related topics of educational material, users may see different content based on their activity (reading/watching courses etc).  This could potentially be linked to trending AI-related topic.
9) **AI trends in the travel and tourism sector** - As a platform focused towards assistants with computer science queries for both blog posts related topics about travelling, users can see different content based on their activity (visited destinations/countries etc).  This could potentially be linked to trending AI-related topic.
10) **AI trends in the fashion and lifestyle sector** - Similar patterns of tracking user's activities or preferences might happen as an artificial intelligence model developed by Deepseek for providing assistance related topics about personal style, users can see different content based on their activity (fashion styles/trending new items etc).  This could potentially be linked to trending AI-related topic.
